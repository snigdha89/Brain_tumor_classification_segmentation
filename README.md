# Brain_tumor_classification_segmentation
A complete pipeline which first detects the tumor using the CNN and ResNet50 Model and then localizes the tumor location using the Segmentation Model of U-Net and ResUnet. It is a complete pipeline for identifying first the presence of tumor and if tumor is present then segmenting it using the segmentation models.
